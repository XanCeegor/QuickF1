# QuickF1
QuickF1 is a quick stat checking app for Formula 1. You can check the current driver standings, constructor standings, latest race result as well as past race results and upcoming races. It is built using the ![Quasar Framework](https://quasar.dev/) and built for Android using Cordova/Capacitor. It can also be built for iOS using Electron.
This app uses the ![Ergast Developer API](https://ergast.com/mrd/) for retrieiving racing data and stats.
Images are pulled from the offical ![F1.com])(https://f1.com) website. I do not own these images in any way.
This app is built specifically for mobile and is not optimized for browser view even though it can be run in a browser.
